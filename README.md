# Exploring Machine Learning Models for classification and prediction on Football Data
 This project aims to utilize KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) methodology to apply various machine learning algorithms to achieve the predictions and classification tasks. The tasks performed are goals prediction for football matches using regression and classification of football match outcomes. Before applying various machine learning models data exploration, data cleaning, and transformation were performed for all the datasets. All the utilized models were evaluated using various parameters. The classification task was performed using Random Forest and the XGBoost algorithm. The overall accuracy of 61% was achieved for our classification task. For our prediction task multiple linear regression, the Lasso regression, and the Ridge regression were used. The parameters of our models were hyper tuned to obtain the best outcomes from the models. For evaluation of these models, RMSE (root mean squared error) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error) were utilized. The conclusions were subsequently formed and comprehensively reported.
